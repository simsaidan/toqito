def rel_entr_quad(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, m: int = 3, k: int = 3) -> np.ndarray:
    r"""
    Returns x.*log(x./y) where x and y are vectors of positive numbers.

    This function implements a second-order cone approximation for the relative
    entropy function. Parameters m and k control the accuracy of this approximation:
    m is the number of quadrature nodes to use and k the number of square-roots to take.
    Default (m, k) = (3, 3).
